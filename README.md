# Image-Filters
Project based in C Programming Language which provides user the option to apply Filters to images. Most image editing programs support a “sepia” filter, which gives images an old-timey feel by making the whole image look a bit reddish-brown. Other options like mirror -  (is a filter where the resulting image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror), GreyScale( where we take an image and want to convert it to black-and-white.) and finally a common Blurr Program
