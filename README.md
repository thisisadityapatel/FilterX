# FilterX

A specially created algorithm, engineered in C langauge,  that divides the file into bytes, individually extracts each pixel, and then uses the user's input to calculate the new hexadecimal RGB values before embedding them into a new file.

Project based in C Programming Language which provides user the option to apply Filters to images. Most image editing programs support a “sepia” filter, which gives images an old-timey feel by making the whole image look a bit reddish-brown. Other options like mirror -  (is a filter where the resulting image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror), GreyScale( where we take an image and want to convert it to black-and-white.) and finally a common Blurr Program
